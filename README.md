### Project Title
Building an image classifier application

### Description
In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. I used a dataset of 102 flower categories. This project was the final project that had to be submitted in order to graduate from Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program:https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089

### Software
I used Python and Pytorch.

### Files
Dataset: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html

Label Mapping: cat_to_name.json

functions.py
train.py
predict.py
workspace_utils.py

Final project submission: "Image Classifier Project.html"

### Credits
This project would not have been possible without the help and guidance received from Udacity's course: AI Programming with Python. Also, there are a few blogs/ articles/ websites of individuals referenced in the .html file that helped me immeasurably to complete this project.
