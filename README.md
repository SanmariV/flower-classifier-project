### Project Title
Exploring Bikeshare Data with R

### Description
Made use of R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and by making visualizations.

### Recommended Software
It is recommended to view the Explore_bikeshare_data.r file in the RStudio IDE which can be downloaded here: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
